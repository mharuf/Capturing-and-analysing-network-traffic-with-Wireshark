<h1>Capturing, filtering, analysing and decrypting network traffic on Wireshark</h1>
This project was completed on Coursera using a cloud desktop on Rhyme. I gained valuable insight into the multifunctional cyber security tool- Wireshark. Following step-by-step instructions, I learned how to capture filtered traffic on Wireshark and how to use display filters. By utilising software installed on the cloud desktop, I was able to generate different types of network traffic to analyse including RADIUS, Telnet/SSH, and HTTPS. I was taught how to view packet and protocol statistics as well as how to view conversations within a packet. Moreover, I learned how to decrypt encrypted packets on Wireshark. This was a very enjoyable experience as I was exposed to one of the many tools cyber security professionals use in their attempts to protect against threats.
